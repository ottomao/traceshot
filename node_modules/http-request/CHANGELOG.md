## v0.6.3
 * New option: auth. Defines the HTTP Authentication parameters. Currently it only supports Basic authentication.

## v0.6.2
 * Closes [#24](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-request/issues/24). Keeps the host header specified into the request headers when the location header contains a relative path.
 * Adds some debugging info to the noRedirect option, the redirect-to-url and redirect-to-host as response headers. Related to the #24 issue.

## v0.6.1
 * Fixed the typo in content-length for Buffer reqBody.

## v0.6.0
 * Client rewritten almost from scratch for including broader HTTP support. Renamed to http-request to indicate this change. New HTTP method wrappers: DELETE, POST, PUT.
 * Strict about user errors. They are considered unrecoverable aka won't fix without changing the code, hence they throw. Passing these to the completion callback has only one outcome: to conceal bugs.
 * Removed the support for HTTPS proxies since there's no way to do it properly, unless you actually control the proxy, which opens a door for MITM attacks.
 * The progress callback option is now available for all response handlers (file, buffer, stream).
 * Fix: the 201, 202, 203, 205 responses are handled as success (as they should).
 * Fix: the 305 responses are not handled as simple redirects. The library uses the location header information as options.proxy.
 * The 300 Multiple Choices responses are handled as errors instead of redirects. The location header, by RFC, indicates a preference, not something that must be automatically followed. It is up to the developer by using the response body (entity) to pick what to do next, or use the location header in a subsequent request.
 * Added a new option: noRedirect. Returns the headers and body (if applicable), for redirect requests.
 * Documentation generated with JSDoc 3.

## v0.5.9
 * Changes the internal buffering concatenation to a much faster implementation: Buffer.concat by using the buffer-concat module for node.js v0.6.

## v0.5.8
 * Fixes the event loop hanging due to the new implementation of Streams in node.js v0.10. The "edge cases" of the "old mode" Steam implementation miss a simple case where a client does not need to actually consume a stream (eg: a HEAD request). The node.js http.js client is implemented as Readable Stream, hence the issue.

## v0.5.7
 * Fixes the broken HTTP Authentication support for node.js v0.6.x. The node.js core url.parse does not decode the URL encoding of the username and password.

## v0.5.6
 * Accept-Encoding is now user definable, even with the lack of options.noCompress.
 * Deprecated node.js v0.8.4 and lower for HTTPS. The absolute minimum supported version will be node.js v0.8.5.

## v0.5.5
 * An url property is attached to the error argument which is passed to the callback if error is set. [#15](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/15)

## v0.5.4
 * Fixing the URL fragment handling. Fragments should not be passed from the user agent to the server. [#14](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/14)

## v0.5.3
 * The url property is attached to the response only when there's a redirect, as the documentation states. Previously, it was returned for all requests due to faulty logic implemented in the input validator. Simplified the internal handling of the request counter for the loop detector.
 * Surpresses the deprecation warnings when the download target is a file path. [#12](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/12)

## v0.5.2
 * Returns proper response when using streams. [#13](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/pull/13)

## v0.5.1
 * Updates the bundled Certificate data from Mozilla to v1.87.

## v0.5
 * [MAY BREAK COMPAT] Added mandatory certificate validation for the HTTPS client. The library bundles its own ca-bundle.crt as provided by Mozilla. Own Certificate Authority information may be provided via options.ca. It may be disabled it via options.noSslValidation. It breaks the clients that use HTTPS URLs with servers that use self signed certificates, or where the certificate information is wrong or expired.
 * Fixes the broken handling of buffered responses when the request is retried with options.noCompress. [#11](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/pull/11)
 * Enables passing a String as URL instead of the options Object. Internally this is handled as `options = {url: options};`. However, this won't be usable without warnings for buffered responses until the migration to Buffer is fully complete.
 * Deprecated options.nocompress in favor of options.noCompress. Makes the API to be consistent.
 * Deprecated options.maxbody in favor of options.maxBody.
 * Deprecated options.noua in favor of options.noUserAgent. More explicit for the reader.
 * Deprecated options.redirects in favot of options.maxRedirects.
 * Deprecated options.bufferType = 'string', althoug keeping it as default in order to notify the users of this library to switch to the Buffer implementation. Also deprecates options.encoding since it doesn't make any sense if the buffer is passed as Buffer instance.
 * Uses the native node.js event emitter.
 * The 206 response is handled as success. Enables the usage of range requests for fetching partial objects.
 * Added options.stream flag in order to pass a Readable Stream instead of Buffer, the HTTP / HTTPS response Object or the zlib decoded stream for encoded responses. The Readable Stream is passed in paused state so you won't miss data events.
 * jslint compliant.

## v0.4.2
 * Fixes the null as file argument when the response is a redirect. The body of the response was buffered instead of being discarded.

## v0.4.1
 * Passing null as the file argument to http.get turns off saving the response body.
 * Fixes the HTTP Basic authentication support. [#9](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/9)
 * Attaches the HTTP(S) response body to the error argument, if possible, for 203 status codes.

## v0.4
 * [BREAKS COMPAT] node.js v0.6.11+ support. Drops support for node.js v0.4. [#3](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/3)
 * New option: bufferType for specifying the fact that the library should return the buffers as [Buffer](http://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html) instance instead of String instance.
 * New option: encoding for specifying the encoding of the returned buffers, when returning the buffered data as string. Defaults to 'utf8'. [#5](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/5)
 * Native node.js zlib support. Includes both gzip and deflate transparent decompression. Available only for node.js v0.6.18+ due to bugs into the zlib bindings [#3230](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/3230).
 * Deprecated options.nogzip in favor of options.nocompress.
 * New option: noua for tuning off the default User-Agent header.
 * New option: progress for passing a callback indicating the download progress. [#8](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/8)
 * New option: debug for reporting the protocol violations that are silently dropped. For node.js 0.6.18+ the gzip / deflate content is decoded even when the client did not send the accept-encoding header. With this option, this situation is reported as warning in STDERR.
 * The 4xx errors attach the body of the HTTP(S) response, if possible. [#7](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/7)
 * If the Last-Modified header is set, then for the file downloads it keeps the timestamp as the mtime value. [#6](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/6)

## v0.3.14
 * New option: progress for passing a callback indicating the download progress. [#8](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/8)
 * The 4xx errors attach the body of the HTTP(S) response, if possible. [#7](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/7)

## v0.3.13
 * Made a v0.6 specific workaround where the request may be retried when the maxbody error is returned.
 * Support for node v0.6.11+. Previous versions of node.js are broken due to [#2688](https://github.com/joyent/node/pull/2688).

## v0.3.12
 * Makes sure options.timeout is disabled for node v0.4.x since request.setTimeout() is unavailable.

## v0.3.11
 * Added options.timeout by [cmtt](https://github.com/cmtt).

## v0.3.10
 * Fixes a protocol breaking. The server may respond with gzip encoded content although not requested.

## v0.3.9
 * Updates the gzbz2 dependency to v0.1.1. Removes the bundled patched version of gunzipstream.js since the upstream avoids the gunzip -5 errors.

## v0.3.8
 * Fixes [#1](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/http-get/issues/1): Get with file does not callback.

## v0.3.7
 * Improves the stability of the gzip support. In some cases, broken servers prematurely close the connection for gzipped responses. The request is now reissued without the gzip support.

## v0.3.6
 * Improved the stability of the fsync(2) wrapper. The ocasional ENOENT errors should dissapear now.
 * Fixes the auto-prefix functionality: if the http:// or https:// is missing, then http:// is automatically prepended. Now it specifically checks for http:// or https://.

## v0.3.5
 * Makes gzbz2 to be an optional dependency. If it doesn't build, you can still use http-get.

## v0.3.4
 * Implemented the upstream proposed patch for the [gz.inflate() issue of node-gzbz2](https://github.com/Woodya/node-gzbz2/pull/1).
 * Removed the workaround for the node.js issue [#1202](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1202). node.js v0.4.11 is the minimal supported version by this release.

## v0.3.3
 * Fixes the HEAD method that wronfully used http.get() / https.get().
 * Workaround for node.js issue [#1202](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/1202).

## v0.3.2
 * This release includes a patched version of the gzbz2/gunzipstream module in order to workaround the gz error -5. The rest of the gzip dependency is still taken from the upstream module.

## v0.3.1
 * The library calls the error code if the server prematurely closes the connection. In the future, if the accept-ranges header is defined into the response headers, the library should try to send subsequent requests in order to get the whole response.

## v0.3
 * Dropped the [compressor](https://github.com/egorich239/node-compress) module in favor of [gzbz2](https://github.com/Woodya/node-gzbz2). More stable gzip support as the compressor module proved to completely hang the module in certain cases when it would not emit any of the end / close events.
 * Better interaction with the disk operations. The module makes use of [fsync(2)](http://linux.die.net/man/2/fsync).

## v0.2.1
 * Simple maintenance release for cleaning up the junk from the npm package.

## v0.2
 * Internal change: simpler method for detecting a redirect.
 * In order to follow the node.js callback convention, in case of success, the error argument is null, not undefined. This may break some existing code if the evaluation is made against 'undefined'.
 * Fixes the maxbody support as both the fail and the success code was executed in certain race conditions.
 * Fixes the file stream support as both the fail and the success code was executed in certain race conditions.
 * Unit testing coverage.

## v0.1.6
 * Internal changes to follow the [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) principle.
 * Added the response.url property of a successful response that comes after a redirect in order to return the final URL of the request.
 * Added the head method for sending HEAD requests. It's nice to poke at the remote resource without bothering with the response body.
 * Added the documentation as wiki pages which makes it more maintainable.

## v0.1.5
 * node.js 0.4.10 specific build. Basically it removes the [backport-0.4](https://github.com/SaltwaterC/backport-0.4) dependency which is now obsolete.
 * In case of HTTP failure, the error argument also contains a headers property that returns the raw response headers.

## v0.1.4
 * Added support for options.nogzip to disable the gzip encoding.
 * Made sure that if gzip fails, the request is sent again with options.nogzip enabled.

## v0.1.3
 * Exposes setMaxSockets() for changing the http.Agent.defaultMaxSockets value.
 * Fixes the lack of accept-encoding: gzip that was commented by mistake aka no transparent gzip support in v0.1.1 - v0.1.2.

## v0.1.2
 * Explicit node version < 0.5.0 in package.json as the compressor module segfaults under node v0.5.0.

## v0.1.1
 * Implemented the options.maxbody option in order to limit the size of the buffered response.

## v0.1
 * Initial version, featuring HTTP / HTTPS support, transparent gzip support, buffered / saved to disk responses, HTTP / HTTPS proxy support.
